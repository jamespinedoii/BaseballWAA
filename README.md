# BaseballWAA
A project that attempts to apply advanced metric techniques for simple use everywhere - even a little league game!

The point of this project is to meld these two things: a desire to play baseball with my son and my new-found data science skills. Through this combination, I would like to help my son improve at baseball, perhaps even helping other young players as well. I will look at very simple counting stats, something that a dad in the stands or coach with access to a piece of paper and a pencil, can keep track of and then compile into a single statistic that weights each stat based upon the historical value that these simple stats have contributed to generating winning teams.
